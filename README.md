## About
As part of a Noroff assignment, I created la-Boutique, an intuitive, functional, and responsive eCommerce website using React. Users can effortlessly add items to their cart and enjoy flexibility with options to add or remove selected products. The site is styled with Bootstrap and styled components, ensuring a seamless user experience. To enhance data validation, I incorporated a validated contact form utilizing Yup and react-hook-form. This project marked my initiation into React application development, and its implementation presented a valuable learning experience
